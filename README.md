Bluetooth Audio is  an NVDA add-on that improves sound quality when working with bluetooth or RF headphones or speakers.

Most bluetooth devices enter standby mode after a few seconds of inactivity. That means that when NVDA starts speaking again, the first split second of sound will be lost. Bluetooth Audio add-on prevents bluetooth devices from entering standby mode by constantly playing a silent sound, that is inaudible to a human ear.

Warning: using Bluetooth Audio add-on might reduce battery life of your bluetooth device.
