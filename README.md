# Notice

Bluetooth Audio add-on has been resurrected in 2025. Now instead of playing silence or white noise it plays a high frequency (20 KHz) sine wave, that is inaudible to human ear, yet it tricks some bluetooth devices to not enter standby mode prematurely.

Bluetooth Audio is  an NVDA add-on that improves sound quality when working with bluetooth or RF headphones or speakers.

Most bluetooth devices enter standby mode after a few seconds of inactivity. That means that when NVDA starts speaking again, the first split second of sound will be lost. Bluetooth Audio add-on prevents bluetooth devices from entering standby mode by constantly playing a high frequency sound, that is inaudible to a human ear.

Warning: using Bluetooth Audio add-on might reduce battery life of your bluetooth device.

## Keystrokes
Bluetooth Audio add-on doesn't have any keystrokes. It works as long as it is installed.
